# computation explanation

# pressure = depth / 10 + atmo_press
# required_volume = time x conso x pressure / tank_pressure

# this is total pressure

# time with this bloc including second rule :
# time = volume * press / conso * abs pressure

# final pressure = (depth/10 + 1) * time 



# following point :
# depth :
# absolute pressure :  (water pressure : )
# consumption at depth :
# actual pressure :
# time possible at this depth

# Note that by diving with a buddy, you may share your air with him in case of accident.
